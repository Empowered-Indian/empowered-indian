              <h3>What is MPLADS?</h3>
              <p>
                MPLADS (Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme) is a Central Government scheme that enables Members of Parliament to recommend works for development in their constituencies. It's designed to create durable community assets and infrastructure.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="qa">
              <h3>Who can participate in MPLADS?</h3>
              <p>
                All Members of Parliament (both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) are eligible to participate. Lok Sabha MPs recommend works in their constituencies, while Rajya Sabha MPs can recommend works in any state they are elected from.

              <h3>Who implements MPLADS projects?</h3>
              <p>
                District Collectors act as the nodal officers for MPLADS implementation. They coordinate with various implementing agencies like local bodies, government departments, and registered organizations to execute the recommended projects.

              <h3>Can MPLADS funds be pooled with other government schemes?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, MPLADS funds can be pooled with MGNREGA (for material component), Khelo India, and other Central/State schemes. MPLADS funds should be used last to fill gaps in the overall project funding.

              <h3>How much MPLADS fund does each MP receive annually?</h3>
              <p>
                Each MP receives ₹5 crores annually. This amount has evolved over time: it started with ₹5 lakh in 1993-94, increased to ₹1 crore in 1994-95, ₹2 crores in 1998-99, and ₹5 crores from 2011-12 onwards.

              <h3>What happens if an MP serves less than a full year?</h3>
              <p>
                The allocation depends on service duration: Less than 3 months gets no allocation, 3 to 9 months gets 50% of annual allocation, and more than 9 months gets 100% of annual allocation.

              <h3>What happened to MPLADS during COVID-19?</h3>
              <p>
                MPLADS was suspended from April 6, 2020 to November 9, 2021. No funds were allocated for FY 2020-21, and only ₹2 crores were allocated for the balance period of FY 2021-22.

              <h3>What are the mandatory allocations for SC/ST development?</h3>
              <p>
                At least 15% of annual MPLADS entitlement must be used for SC (Scheduled Caste) areas and at least 7.5% for ST (Scheduled Tribe) areas. If there's insufficient ST population, funds can be used for SC areas and vice versa.

                Elected MPs can recommend works worth ₹25 lakhs per year outside their usual area. For natural calamities, they can contribute up to ₹1 crore anywhere in India. Nominated Rajya Sabha MPs can recommend works anywhere in the country.

                Generally within 1 year from sanction date. Exceptional cases (like hilly terrain) may take longer with proper justification. Works of ex-MPs must be completed within 18 months of demitting office.

                Yes, if registered for at least 3 years and engaged in social service, registered on NITI Aayog's Darpan Portal with Unique ID. Maximum ₹50 lakhs per MP per year, ₹1 crore per society during MP's entire term. Assets become government property.

              <h3>How can MPLADS funds help during natural disasters?</h3>
              <p>
                Any MP can contribute up to ₹1 crore for "Calamity of Severe Nature" declared by Government of India. For state-declared calamities, MPs from that state can contribute up to ₹25 lakhs. Consent should be given within 90 days of calamity declaration.

                A completed project is one that has been fully executed and handed over for use. The completion status is based on reports from implementing agencies and district administration to the MPLADS portal.

                Low utilization could indicate various factors: recent election (new MP), complex project approvals, local administrative delays, or strategic planning for larger multi-year projects. It's important to consider these contextual factors when analyzing utilization rates.

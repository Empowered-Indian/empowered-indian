              At <strong>Empowered Indian</strong>, we believe democracy works best when citizens have access to clear, reliable, and actionable information about their government. Our mission is simple yet ambitious: to make our government visible, searchable, and accountable.

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
              We aggregate and present public data, from Parliament to Panchayats, in a way that's easy for anyone to explore. From tracking MPLADS and MLALADS fund utilization, to uncovering project progress, budgets, and key decision-makers, our platform transforms scattered data into transparent, interactive dashboards.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not just building a website. We're building a civic movement. By combining open data, technology, and citizen participation, we aim to bridge the gap between government actions and public awareness.
